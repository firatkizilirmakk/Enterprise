# Enterprise
	A 2d space shooter game made using Allegro5 for First Year Summer Project given in Gebze Technical University,CSE department
	
  Since Allegro5 is used as a game engine,whole game is written in C programming language.
  <br/>
  In the game,there is two mode for the ship called Enterprise :).<br/>By pressing 'A',mode is switched to auto-pilot where moves of the ship are done Finite State Machine logic.<br/><br/>Also there are some levels becoming harder while moving without being killed.<br/><br/>At the end there is a Boss who is also featured with a finite state machine,so it moves according to player moves to avoid being killed.
  
  To play this game in Linux distrubitions,the game must be compiled with Allegro5 library.So the library must be set up.<br/>
  In order to install the library and compile the game,a guide for setting up can be read written by me in Turkish<br/>through
